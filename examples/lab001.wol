# This an example of a text file containing hardware addresses 
#
# File structure
# --------------
# - blank lines are ignored
# - comment lines are ignored (lines starting with a hash mark '#')
# - other lines are considered valid records and can have 3 columns:
#
#       Hardware address, IP address, destination port, DDNS domain
#
#   the last three are optional, in which case the following defaults
#   are used:
#
#       IP address: 255.255.255.255 (the limited broadcast address)
#       port:       9 (the discard port)
#       DDNS domain: '' (this will replace IP address)
